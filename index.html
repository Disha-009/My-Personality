        <h1> Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"> </div>
        <p> My name is Disha. I am interested in studying human body. My hobbies are singing, dancing, and reading. My favourite colours are pink and purple. I am very fond of pet animals. I love looking at historical buildings and try reading the writings on them. I like looking at the stars and the moon at night. I talk to the celestial bodies at night, whenever I am sad. Whenever I am happy, I sing a happy song, whereas, whenever I am sad, I either do division sums or sing a song in my own words with the tune of released melody songs. I believe in imagination, for example, "I believe that there is some or the other magical character in our world or another world"! I always prefer to understand someone rather than scolding, or advicing them. I get disappointed, when someone compare me, with another person. I get angry when people don't believe me, even when I am telling the truth. The people who really make me happy are my parents, Kousie ma'am, and my friends. I like writing stories. The real wonder place of mine, is my School. In my school, with my friends around me, I feel as if I am surrounded with postive energy. My friends support me whenever I am in a tight spot. Whether it is a boy or a girl, no matter what, I feel happy that they are my friends, and I feel lucky whenever I am in my school. My parents are the ones who support me, in my house, with love and care.<br></br>

My mother is my personal secret beauty, and my father is my Bheeshmar. My sister my entertainer. I have no one whom I dislike, in the world or in the whole universe. The reason for my good personality, are the bullies in my school, who bullied me. Even though, they did a bad thing, I consumed it to be a helpful incident. Even if someome consider me as their enemy, I will try my best to support them in any way. The worst choice of mine is, Giving Up. I never give up, no matter what.I think death is no more powerful, when it comes to giving up. As per my opinion, I think, the caste system is no need. It creates a mental difference between people, which creates a new appearence called discrimination. I think, the one who think another person's religion is bad and my religion is good, he/she criticises one's own religion. I think, people should think about the present, rather than thinking and creating a fear about the future. Present is gift for us, and hence, it is called as "Present". My ambition is to become a surgeon, and an entrepreneur. I will try my best to accomplish all my dreams, which are meant for my teachers, friends, parents, our country, and finally the world. THANK YOU!</p>

  <p> My favourite hobbies are dancing and singing. Dancing help us to burn calories, and is also like an exercise. It is the most enjoyable hobbie. It helps us to kill time. Singing is a heart warming hobbie. It helps us to change a lot of things. Music is an avatar of god.
